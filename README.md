# Home Network Asset Inventory & Classification

## Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental asset management and risk based
classification for a small home office network. Asset management is a
core security practice used to identify, track, and protect systems that
store or transmit sensitive information.

## Objective
- Identify assets connected to a home network
- Document ownership, network access, and physical location
- Evaluate security impact using the CIA triad
- Classify assets based on sensitivity

## Assets Evaluated
- Network Router
- Desktop Computer
- Guest Smartphone
- External Hard Drive
- Smart Webcam
- Printer

## Methodology
Each asset was evaluated based on:
- Network access frequency
- Ownership and user responsibility
- Physical location
- Type of data stored or accessed
- Potential impact if compromised

Sensitivity classifications were assigned using standard security
categories such as Public, Internal only, Confidential, and Restricted.

## Key Security Observations
- Always connected devices increase exposure if compromised
- Devices storing sensitive data require stricter access controls
- Guest devices expand the attack surface
- Asset classification supports prioritization of security controls

## Outcome
This project documents a structured approach to asset inventory creation,
risk evaluation, and sensitivity classification within a small network
environment.
